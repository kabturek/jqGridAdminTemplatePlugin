jqGrid theme for symfony 1.4 admin module
=========================================
Here is a theme that uses jqGrid instead of the default tables in the symfony
admin module.
I've tested it only on symfony 1.4.

Usage
------
To use it change 'theme: admin' to 'theme: jqgrid' in your modules
generator.yml.

This is a work in progress, only the basics are supported (list).
